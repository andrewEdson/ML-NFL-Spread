# 🏈 NFL Spread Prediction ML Project

A machine learning project to predict NFL point spreads using team performance statistics and betting data. The models achieve **53%+ accuracy** on future games with proper chronological validation to prevent data leakage.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts whether the home team will cover the betting spread for NFL games using:

- **Team offensive/defensive statistics** (passing, rushing, receiving)
- **Historical performance metrics** with rolling averages
- **Betting market data** (spreads, moneylines, totals)
- **Game context** (weather, rest days, coaches, referees)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ML-NFL-Spread

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models

```bash
# Train XGBoost model (recommended)
python scripts/model_scripts/xgb_train.py

# Train Random Forest model
python scripts/model_scripts/rf_train.py
```

### 3. Compare Model Performance

```bash
# Compare feature importance between models
python evaluation/eval.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model         | Accuracy   | Training Period | Test Period | Notes                    |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| **XGBoost**   | **53.04%** | 1999-2021       | 2022-2023   | Best overall performance |
| Random Forest | 51.57%     | 1999-2021       | 2022-2023   | Baseline model           |

_Note: Uses chronological validation (no data leakage) - predicting actual future games_

## ⚠️ Data Leakage Discovery & Fix

### The Problem

Initially, the models achieved **~78% accuracy** using random train/test splits, which seemed too good to be true. Upon investigation, I discovered **data leakage**:

- Using team stats from the **same week** as the game being predicted
- Random splits allowed the model to "peek" at future information
- This created unrealistic performance that wouldn't work in practice

### The Solution

1. **Time-shifted features**: Shifted all team statistics by 1 week (only use past performance)
2. **Chronological validation**: Train on 1999-2021, test on 2022-2023 (no future data)
3. **Rolling averages**: Use 3-week rolling means instead of single-game stats

**Result**: More realistic 53% accuracy that represents genuine predictive power for future games.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Pipeline

1. **Raw Data**: NFL game schedules + player statistics via `nfl-data-py`
2. **Team Aggregation**: Player stats → team-level weekly performance
3. **Time-shift**: Prevent data leakage by using only past performance
4. **Rolling Features**: 3-week rolling averages for trend analysis
5. **Feature Engineering**: 50+ features including team stats and betting data

### Key Features (Built-in Model Importance)

**XGBoost prioritizes:**

1. **Roof/Venue conditions** - Indoor vs outdoor stadiums
2. **Betting market signals** - Over/under odds
3. **Receiving performance** - Passing game metrics
4. **Turnover statistics** - Interceptions and fumbles

**Random Forest prioritizes:**

1. **Personnel factors** - QB names, coaches, referees
2. **Advanced metrics** - EPA (Expected Points Added)
3. **Rushing efficiency** - Ground game performance
4. **Environmental factors** - Temperature, conditions

### Model Architecture

- **XGBoost Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning
- **54 engineered features** from team stats and betting data
- **Chronological train/test split** (1999-2021 train, 2022-2023 test)
- **Data leak prevention** via time-shifted features

## 🎯 Model Insights & Feature Analysis

### Different Models, Different Strategies

The models learned completely different patterns with **zero overlap** in top 10 features:

**XGBoost Strategy:**

- **Situational factors**: Stadium conditions, betting market signals
- **Game flow metrics**: Receiving yards, turnover statistics
- **Environmental context**: Venue type, over/under betting lines

**Random Forest Strategy:**

- **Personnel-driven**: Individual QB performance, coaching impact
- **Advanced efficiency**: EPA metrics for rushing/passing/receiving
- **Human factors**: Referee influence, individual player impact

### Key Discovery

No common features in top 10 suggests **ensemble potential** - the models are finding value in complementary aspects of NFL games, making them excellent candidates for stacking or blending approaches.

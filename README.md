# 🏈 NFL Spread Prediction ML Project

A comprehensive machine learning project to predict NFL point spreads using team performance statistics, injury data, and betting information. The ensemble of **4 different models** achieves consistent performance with proper chronological validation to prevent data leakage.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts whether the home team will cover the betting spread for NFL games using:

- **Team offensive/defensive statistics** (passing, rushing, receiving)
- **Historical performance metrics** with rolling averages
- **Injury data integration** (2009+) with position-specific severity mapping
- **Betting market data** (spreads, moneylines, totals)
- **Game context** (weather, rest days, coaches, referees)
- **Advanced analytics** with SHAP explainability and ensemble methods

### 🔬 Advanced Analytics

- **SHAP Analysis**: Model explainability with feature importance visualization
- **Ensemble Methods**: 4-model averaging for robust predictions
- **Injury Integration**: Position-specific injury severity mapping (2009+)
- **Feature Comparison**: Zero overlap in top features between models

_Note: Uses chronological validation (no data leakage) - predicting actual future games_

## ⚠️ Data Leakage Discovery & Fix

### The Problem

Initially, the models achieved **~78% accuracy** using random train/test splits, which seemed too good to be true. Upon investigation, I discovered **data leakage**:

- Using team stats from the **same week** as the game being predicted
- Random splits allowed the model to "peek" at future information
- This created unrealistic performance that wouldn't work in practice

### The Solution

1. **Time-shifted features**: Shifted all team statistics by 1 week (only use past performance)
2. **Chronological validation**: Train on 1999-2021, test on 2022-2023 (no future data)
3. **Rolling averages**: Use 3-week rolling means instead of single-game stats

**Result**: More realistic 53% accuracy that represents genuine predictive power for future games.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Pipeline

1. **Raw Data**: NFL game schedules + player statistics via `nfl-data-py`
2. **Injury Integration**: Position-specific injury mapping with severity weights
3. **Team Aggregation**: Player stats → team-level weekly performance
4. **Time-shift**: Prevent data leakage by using only past performance
5. **Rolling Features**: 3-week rolling averages for trend analysis
6. **Feature Engineering**: 78+ features including injury metrics and betting data

### Multi-Model Approach

**4 Specialized Models:**

1. **Random Forest**: Personnel-focused (QB names, coaches, referees)
2. **LightGBM**: Efficient gradient boosting with feature interaction
3. **CatBoost**: Native categorical feature handling (no encoding needed)
4. **XGBoost**: Advanced boosting with hyperparameter optimization

**Ensemble Strategy:**

- Simple averaging of all 4 model predictions
- Categorical feature decoding for CatBoost compatibility
- Real test data validation (543 games from 2022-2023)

### Key Features (Built-in Model Importance)

**Random Forest prioritizes:**

1. **Personnel factors** - QB names, coaches, referees (encoded)
2. **Betting market signals** - Total line, spread line

**LightGBM prioritizes:**

1. **Personnel factors** - QB and coach encoded features
2. **Team efficiency** - Passing EPA, rushing yards
3. **Market context** - Total line betting information
4. **Game flow** - Fantasy points, EPA metrics

**CatBoost prioritizes:**

1. **Categorical variables** - Raw QB names, coaches, referees
2. **Team identity** - Home/away team categories
3. **Efficiency metrics** - EPA and rushing performance
4. **Betting context** - Spread and total lines

### Model Architecture
